In my case, I am a product of a highly-competitive environment, born on November 12, 1993 in Silicon Valley. At a young age, I competed in sports leagues and was raised in one of the most competitive public education systems in the country, Los Altos School District. However, becoming a &quot;differentiated product&quot; of your environment requires exposure to nuanced and authentic experiences. I have been fortunate enough to travel to many parts of the world including; Turkey, Israel, Spain, and Italy to name a few. Seeing different parts of the world and interacting within different cultures, has enabled me to develop a global perspective and well-rounded approach on how I would like to live my life.<br/><br/>Additionally, I have been exposed to various job functions and industries that have shaped my personality and work ethic. Playing water polo in high school allowed me to teach swim lessons and lifeguard at my local YMCA. Giving back something valuable to younger kids within my community gave me satisfaction and gratification that I was making an impact and helping others who were less fortunate than me. In the future, I am excited and eager to use my educational, professional, and experiential knowledge to continue to give back and improve the community I surround myself in. Instead of &quot;becoming a product of my environment&quot;,  I hope to create a profound impact, both professionally and personally, to cultivate a positive environment for others.</p></div></div><div class="section accent wf-section"><div class="w-container"><div class="section-title-group"><h2 class="section-heading centered white">Professional Aspirations</h2><div class="section-subheading center off-white">The Future Steps</div></div><div class="w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6"><div class="white-box transparent"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63e79b003f712735f02f201c/63e79b003f712735662f204b_cleveland-stadium-overhead.jpg" width="325" height="216" alt="" class="fullwidth-image"/><h3 class="white-text">Sports Enthusiast</h3><p class="white-text">For me sports has been a huge part of my life.
